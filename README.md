### What I learned

I started this challenge to improve my web content structuring and advanced styling in mind. That's why I challenged myself to create the styling using Sass and BEM method.

It was hard at first, and this is really my first time using Sass. Most of the time when I do challenge from frontend mentor, I always use vanilla CSS.

I learned so much about advanced CSS styling by using this Sass method:

- I learn how to plan my styling by using so many partial Scss/Sass file.
- I learn how to use variables in Sass
- I learn how to use @mixin, function, and so many more

I also learn how to create a styling using BEM method, which is using block, element, and modifier classes, eventhough maybe the class attribute looking little bit cramped with lots of classes, but it does the job when you styling.
